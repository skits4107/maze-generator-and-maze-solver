# Maze Generator and Solver

A project I made for fun. right now it is able to use versions of the DFS algorithm to generate and solve a perfect maze.
the genration and solving is animated over time.

# future plans

in the future I plan to add more interactability to the project such as adding various UI elements to control various properties and settings such as 
the animation speed, grid size, cell size, and the algorithms to use. I also plan on adding more types of algorithms.
